# Network-Penetration-Testing-Metasploit-Framework
Network Penetration Testing Using the Metasploit Framework

## Objective
This project demonstrates comprehensive penetration testing methodologies against a vulnerable Active Directory environment using the Metasploit Framework. The primary objective is to showcase the complete attack lifecycle—from initial reconnaissance and exploitation through post-exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and persistence—while documenting defensive countermeasures and detection strategies.

##Skills Learned
Technical Skills
Exploitation & Attack Techniques:
Conducting network reconnaissance and enumeration using built-in Metasploit modules
Exploiting SMB vulnerabilities (EternalBlue, MS08-067) for initial access
Performing credential harvesting using Mimikatz and Kiwi extensions
Executing Kerberoasting attacks to extract service account credentials
Leveraging pass-the-hash (PsExec) for lateral movement
Utilizing Meterpreter for advanced post-exploitation activities
Creating persistent backdoors using various Metasploit techniques
Conducting privilege escalation through token impersonation and stolen credentials

Active Directory Security:

Understanding Active Directory architecture and common attack vectors
Identifying misconfigurations in AD environments (weak passwords, excessive permissions, outdated systems)
Analyzing Kerberos authentication weaknesses and exploitation methods
Recognizing trust relationships and delegation issues
Understanding Group Policy vulnerabilities

Framework Proficiency:

Mastering Metasploit Framework architecture (modules, payloads, encoders, listeners)
Creating and customizing exploit modules and payloads
Configuring advanced Meterpreter features (pivoting, port forwarding, routing)
Using auxiliary modules for scanning and enumeration
Managing sessions and multi-handler configurations

Network & System Knowledge:

Understanding Windows authentication protocols (NTLM, Kerberos)
Analyzing network traffic and identifying exploitation indicators
Working with PowerShell for remote execution and persistence
Understanding Windows privilege levels and security contexts
Navigating Windows registry and system configurations

Professional Skills
Security Analysis:

Conducting structured vulnerability assessments
Performing impact analysis for discovered vulnerabilities
Creating threat models based on discovered attack paths
Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk and exploitability

Documentation & Reporting:

Writing clear, technical penetration testing reports
Creating executive summaries for non-technical stakeholders
Documenting exploitation procedures with reproducible steps
Providing evidence through screenshots, logs, and command outputs
Structuring findings with severity ratings and CVSS scores

Defensive Thinking:

Identifying detection opportunities for each attack technique
Recommending specific security controls and configurations
Understanding blue team perspectives and defensive strategies
Proposing monitoring and logging improvements

Compliance & Ethics:

Following responsible disclosure practices
Understanding legal and ethical boundaries of penetration testing
Maintaining proper documentation for audit trails
Applying industry frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST)
